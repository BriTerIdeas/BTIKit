 OVERVIEW
 
 This is a view controller class intended to provide common elements needed to support a table view.  It does not, however, provide a primary data storage mechanism, leaving that for subclasses to define.  It can be viewed as an alternative to UITableViewController, though it does not deliberately attempt to replicate any functionality of that class.
 
 This class is intended to be used with a XIB file containing a UITableView, however if the IBOutlet has not been populated by the time viewWillAppear is called, a full-screen, plain table view will be created.
 
 This class implements the minimum setup necessary to support a UISearchDisplayController.  Subclasses must override the handleSearchForTerm: method in order to implement the actual search logic that this class does not provide.
 
 The selectionSet is provided to handle cases where multiple selections (ex: checkmarks) would be useful, and the selectedObject is for single selection.  This class does not implement any logic utilizing these properties, merely makes them available.
 
 To unify table view datasource/delegate methods, the itemInTableView:atIndexPath: method is provided.  This class does not implement any particular logic.  Subclasses should override this method to select an appropriate object depending on which table view is asking.

/// A collection of "selected" objects. This is not automatically used anywhere, merely provided for convenience. Can be used with checkmarks. Items in the set are "selected", all others are not, etc.

/// If the UISearchDisplayController, this will be populated with the search field text. Subclasses should use this combined with handleSearchForTerm: to filter contents.
